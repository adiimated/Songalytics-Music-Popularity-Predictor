# Songalytics: Spotify Data Analytics

## Introduction

## Data set

The dataset I used is a comprehensive compilation of Spotify tracks across 125 different genres, stored in a tabular CSV format. It offers a broad spectrum of audio features and metadata for each track, including the track's ID, artists, album name, popularity score, duration, explicitness, and numerous audio properties like danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, and time signature.
